ðŸ”ºPascal's triangle is the triangular array of numbersðŸ”¢that begins with 1 on the top and with 1's running down the two sides of a triangle. Each new number lies between two numbers and below them, and its value is the sum of the two numbers above it.

| 0x00 | [Pascal Triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle/)                                                                                    | **Pascal's Triangle** is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It represents binomial coefficients and is used in algebra, combinatorics, and probability.|      
| 0x01 | [Lock Boxes](./0x01-lockboxes/)                                                                                     | **Lockboxes** are secure containers or systems used to store valuable items, such as documents or sensitive information, with restricted access that requires authentication or keys to open, ensuring privacy and security.
| 0x02 | [Minimum Operations](./0x02-minimum_operations/)                                                                                      | Minimum operations refer to the fewest actions required to achieve a specific goal or reach a desired state, often used in problem-solving, algorithms, and optimization tasks to minimize effort or resources.                                                                                                                                                                
| 0x03| [Log Parsing](./0x03-log_parsing/)                                                                  | **Log parsing** is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful information from log files, often to monitor system behavior, troubleshoot issues, or gather insights by identifying patterns, errors, and events in the logs.|
|  0x04 |  [Utf8 Validation](./0x04-utf8_validation/)                                                                         | **UTF-8 validation** ensures that text data is properly encoded in the UTF-8 character set, which supports a wide range of characters from different languages, and checks for invalid or corrupted byte sequences to ensure data integrity and correct display.                |
| 0X05  | [N Queens](./0x05-nqueens/)                                                    |The **N-Queens puzzle** is a problem where the goal is to place **N** queens on an **N x N** chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. |
| 0x06  | [Star Wars Api](./0x06-starwars_api/)                                                             | The **Star Wars API** (SWAPI) is a free and open-source API that provides access to data about the Star Wars universe, including information about films, characters, species, starships, vehicles, and planets, allowing developers to retrieve and integrate this data into their applications.|
|  0x07 | [Rotate 2D Matrix](./0x07-rotate_2d_matrix/)                                                                              | **Rotating a 2D matrix** involves shifting its elements by a specified angle, typically 90Â°, 180Â°, or 270Â°, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, resulting in a new arrangement of the matrix elements while maintaining the matrix's structure.|
| 0x08 |  [Making Change](./0x08-making_change/)                                                                       | The makeChange function calculates the minimum number of coins required to make a specific total using a list of coin denominations, returning -1 if it's not possible to make the change.|
| 0x09 | [Island Perimeter](./0x09-island_perimeter/)                                                                   | The island_perimeter function calculates the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid, where land cells are marked as 1 and water cells as 0. It checks the boundaries of each land cell to determine how many sides are exposed to water, and returns the total perimeter. |
